# Management Console

By default, access to management consoles is secured. We therefore need to setup an Application User first.

```
$ bin/add-user.sh

What type of user do you wish to add? 
 a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties) 
 b) Application User (application-users.properties)
```

The [Hawt.io](http://hawt.io/) console should show the camel context from subsystem configuration.
